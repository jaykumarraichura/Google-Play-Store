# Google-Play-Store
Analysis of Business Problems In order to boost user engagement, we will assist Google in analyzing which applications operate best on their platform. Google Play keeps 30% to 40% of the money customers spend on apps or in-app purchases. Google may incentivize third-party app developers to create more engaging applications, hence increasing revenue, by determining which apps function better on the platform.
# # Research Objective 
We plan to create a model that identifies the most important input variables that lead to more downloads and higher ratings, as well as which applications are more likely to receive positive or negative feedback. These metrics will be used to define user engagement.
